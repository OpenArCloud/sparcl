An important feature of sparcl is the conversion of poses. It needs to handle poses in GeoPose format, local format of the XR and 3D engine used. When all works as expected and the code is in good shape, this functionality might even be made available as an npm module.

But this is something for the future. We had quite some trouble to get the conversions between GeoPose and the local pose to work correctly, so the code is a bit all over the place right now. 

Will update this page when there is any progress.
