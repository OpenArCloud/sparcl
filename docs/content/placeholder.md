# Placeholders

Placeholders will be highly configurable through the records stored in the content discovery ([scr](https://openarcloud.github.io/sparcl/guides/developmentmode.html)). A property will be added to the scr soonish to hold such definitions in key / value pairs. This isn't implemented, yet, but will likely be one of the next features to be worked on.

These will include definitions for:
* type:  billboard, sign post
* style: color, rotation
* interaction: click, ...

The idea here is, to keep these objects as lightweight as possible, because there might be loads of them in the AR scene at the same time.
