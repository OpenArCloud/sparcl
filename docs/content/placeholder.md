# Placeholders

Placeholders will be highly configurable through the records stored in the content discovery ([scr](https://openarcloud.github.io/sparcl/guides/developmentmode.html)). A property will be added to the SCR to hold such definitions in key / value pairs. This is not yet implemented, but will likely be one of the next features to be worked on.

These will include definitions for:
* type: billboard, sign post
* style: color, rotation
* interaction: click, ...

The idea here is to keep these objects as lightweight as possible because there might be many of them in the AR scene at the same time.
