# Location access

sparcl is an application that needs location access to offer its functionality. This is why location access is requested right when you use the app the first time.

If, for some reason location access gets blocked after the first use, you need to reenable it before being able to use sparcl again. The way properties work, sparcl can't request location access again, because it's blocked by Android to prevent applications spaming users for permissions.

To allow location access permission again, press the button `Allow location`. If all goes well, the location request dialog is displayed, where you can allow location access.

In case you blocked location access for sparcl before, the location request dialog isn't shown. In that case, you need to allow location access manually. 

## Allow location access when sparcl is run in browser

This is a simple 3 step process:

### Tap on the lock on the left side of the URL

## Allow location access when sparcl is installed

When sparcl is installed on your device, you have the joyce to either open it once in the browser and activate location access as described above, or use the settings dialog of the installed application.
