# Guides for the features of sparcl

Thanks to OSCP, sparcl is very flexible to use and powerful functionality can be implemented easily. This comes with quite some requirements. To make development and content creaton easier, there are specific modes available which simplify setup for these use cases quite a bit.

### Some general notes: 
* The AR-module of WebXR used by sparcl is still heavily under development, currently more or less only implemented in browsers based on Chromium on Android. 
* Before the AR features can be used, the flag `WebXR incubations` at `chrome://flags/` needs to be activated. 
* No AR features are available with Firefox or on iOS.
